                <h1>All Graffiti </h1>
                <p>The word graffiti comes from the Italian word ‘graffito’ which means scratched and the Greek word ‘graphein’ which means to write. This is because the earliest graffiti was carved onto walls and stones.</p>
                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The term was first used by the novelist Norman Mailer when he wrote ‘The Faith of graffiti ‘ in 1974
                    Graffiti has a long history that dates back to the ancient greeks and romans. 
                    These often had political slogans ,love messages or popular quotes. The term is a collective name for images or texts displayed on streets or public places that have been applied with some sort of paint or markers. 
                    Graffiti was mostly illegally produced and often involved unauthorised markings by individuals or groups.</p>
                <p>Nowadays there are a lot of discussions whether graffiti is an art vorm of just plain vandalism. 
                    Even though many find it a vorm of art, graffiti artist like to stay unknown because of the threat of legal action from those who are against graffiti.
