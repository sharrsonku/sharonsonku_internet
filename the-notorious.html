            <h1>A movement is born.</h1>
            <p>Graffiti as we know it now started in the 1970s when New York youth started leaving their names on trains, metros, buildings and so on.   
            These are now called tags which you will read more of in <a href="Styles.html">styles.</a>
            What started as subculture has now become a significant art movement.</p>

    <h2>Darryl McCray</h2>
        <p>Also known as CornBread, is the first graffiti artist. During the mid-1960s 12-year old Darryl tagged his nickname 'CornBread' on the walls of the Philadelphia Youth Development Center, a juvenile correction facility. 
            A few years after he was released, he and his friends took his art to the streets.
            This earned him notoriety, "The more they talked, the more i wrote."  
            When a newspaper article was published stating that he was shot dead CornBread needed to snap the publics attention to denote that he was still alive.
            So he decided to spray his name on a live animal in the Philedelphia zoo. Trying to leave the zoo he got arrested. 
            In the holding cells police officers came to ask for the prisinor that goes by the name CornBread.
            You might have never guessed it but they asked him for his autograph.

    <h2>BlekLekRat</h2>
        <p>Blek le rat ,also known as The father of stencil graffiti, is a French artist who painted images of rats.  
         The rats symbolised marginalised citizens and the urban environment he lived in. 
         Because of this he spreads his art all over Paris, like a plague.  
         After being arrested in 1991 he turned to pre stencil to make it quicker to paint, less likely to get caught again.
         Today Blek is credited as the one to invent life-sized stencils and the first to transform stencil from just plain lettering into imagery.
         However he only started to get accepted and recognition around 2005. 
         According to Blek this is thanks to Banksy.
